# Simulation N° 5: Granular Flow

## Build

To build the project, it is necessary to have _Maven +3.5.0_, and
_Java SE 8 Release_ installed. Then, run:

```
$ mvn clean package
```

This will generate a _\*.jar_ in the `target` folder. If you find any issues
with the building, remove the _\*.jar_ files from the _Maven_ local
repository with:

```
$ rm -fr ~/.m2/repository/ar/edu/itba/ss/*
```

Or do it manually, if you prefer.

## Execute

In the root folder (after build):

```
$ java -jar target/tp5-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <simulate | animate>
```

## Configuration

Receives a JSON file with the following format:

```json

    "output"            : "res/data/output.data",
    "delta"             : "0.0001",
